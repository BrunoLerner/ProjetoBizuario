The idea of this project is to create a new content for the student. A way to synthesize the important aspects of problem solving.

## How does it work?

A platform where the student can save simple hints that can be related to various kinds of problems.
These hints can be linked to real problems that were solved using that.
Should also be possible to tag the problems with the hints.
When the user clicks the saved hint, should see a theoretical explanation for why that works
